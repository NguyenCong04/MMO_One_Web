	"title-body-top": "Tool to optimize and compress images, reducing image size at no cost",
	"content-body-top": "Reduce image file size without losing quality. Compress JPG, PNG, and GIF images for websites, iPhone, and Android",
	"content-body-top2": "Click UPLOAD FILES to choose up to 20 images (PNG, JPG, GIF, TIFF) you want to compress. Wait for the upload and compression processes to complete. If you need more control over the image compression quality please use thumbnails to activate the manual mode.",
	"content-body-top3": "Click DOWNLOAD ALL to get all the compressed files at once, grouped in a ZIP archive. Or you can download each image individually.",
	"title-choose-file": "Click to upload image",
	"h2-content1": "What is Compression?",
	"p1-content1": "In relation to digital files, compression is the act of taking one file and making it smaller by removing bits of information. Sometimes you’re removing empty or useless bits of information so the file reduces in size but it appears exactly the same. This is called lossless compression. On the other hand, if you remove bits that lower the quality of the file, this is known as lossy compression.",
	"p2-content1": "The tool on this page conducts a type of lossy compression by reducing the available color palette or quality of an image.",
	"h2-content2": "Why Compress Images?",
	"p1-content2": "Images are ideal for graphics, logos, and other simple designs because they support transparency. This allows you to place an image on top of another image and only cover specific parts of the image underneath. This is something not possible with many other image formats.",
	"p2-content2": "High-resolution images take up a lot of space and can slow down your page load time. Compressing images reduces the file size without affecting its visible quality, which helps improve your website’s speed.",
	"h2-content3": "How can you compress an image?",
	"p1-content3": "Compressing an image is incredibly simple using our free online tool. There’s no software to download, no need to register, and no limit to the number of compressions you can do.",
	"h2-content4": "Is it safe to compress image files?",
	"p1-content4": "Our compression tool is not only easy to use but completely safe. The server that operates the tool is fully automated, so no one sees the images you upload. Also, the server automatically purges all data after 60 minutes, so anything you upload will be deleted just an hour later. This keeps your data private and secure.",
	"p2-content4": "Also, if you are unhappy with our compression output, you’ll still have your original files. You can then upload the master file again and re-compress it. You can do this as many times as you wish.",
	"title-welcome-faqs": "Frequently Asked Questions",
	"name-faqs1": "What file types does the image compressor support?",
	"text-faqs1": "Our image compressor supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF file types. You can upload a mix of these file types and compress them together.",
	"name-faqs2": "Is there a limit to the number of images I can compress?",
	"text-faqs2": "You can upload and compress up to 20 images at a time. If you have more images, simply repeat the process as needed.",
	"name-faqs3": "Will my images lose quality after compression?",
	"text-faqs3": "Our tool uses advanced algorithms to minimize quality loss. You can also adjust the compression level to find the right balance between file size and image quality.",
	"name-faqs4": "How long does the compression process take?",
	"text-faqs4": "The time required for compression depends on the number and size of the images you upload. Generally, the process is quick, and you can see the progress in real-time.",
